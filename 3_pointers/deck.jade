	h2 What is a pointer?
	
	p  A pointer references a location in memory, and obtaining the value at the location a pointer refers to is known as dereferencing the pointer. (Wikipedia)
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		int age = 27;
	
	div.span9
		div Variable 
			code age
		ul
			li contains 4 bytes (32 bits)
			li and forms the value 27
	div.span5
		img(src="variable.png")
	
	div.note The decision where the value of a variable is located in the memory is a task automatically performed by the operating system during runtime.

.slide
	h2 Pointer declaration
	
	ul
		li A pointer can directly access the value of the memory it's pointing to. Therefore it has to be specified the data type it's pointing to
		
	p Pointer declaration: 
		code type * variable_name;
		
	pre.prettyprint.
		int* p1 = NULL;
		char* p2 = NULL;
		float* p3 = NULL;
		double* p4 = NULL;
	
	div.note These are three declarations of pointers, which point to a different data type. But all of them need the same amount of space in memory (as mentioned before - the size in memory of a pointer depends on the platform where the code is going to run).
	
	ul
		li The asterisk (*) means that the variable is a pointer, don't confuse it with the dereference operator.
		li Always declare a pointer with an initial value (NULL), otherwise it points to an arbitrary address.

.slide
	h2 What is a pointer?
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		int age = 27;
		int* a = &age;
	ul
		li Reference the memory location of a variable with reference operator 
			code \&
		li Pointer variable precedes with an asterisk 
			code *
	
	div.span10
		div Pointer 
			code a
		ul
			li is the memory address where the value of the variable age is stored
			li has a different value than the variable age (since it references the memory location) - in this case 8
	div.span6

.slide
	h2 What is a pointer? - Examples
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		int age = 18;
		int* a = &age; // Get the reference
	
	p The size of a pointer depends on the operating system - get the size of a variable in bytes with 
		code sizeof()
			
	pre.prettyprint.
		cout << sizeof(age) << " bytes" << endl;  // Output: 4 bytes
		cout << sizeof(a) << " bytes" << endl;  // Output on 64-bit machine: 8 bytes

.slide
	h2 Dereference Operator 
		code *
	
	table
		tr
			td
				pre.prettyprint.
					int age = 18;
					int* a = &age;
			td
				img(src="pointer_a_example.png")
		tr
			td
				pre.prettyprint.
					int foo = *a;
			td
				img(src="pointer_foo_a_example.png")

	p Dereference the pointer to get the value in memory, where the pointer points to
	ul
		li Precede the pointer's identifier with an asterisk 
			code *
		li Operand has to be a pointer variable
	
.slide
	h2 Pointer Examples
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		int age = 30;
		int height = 180;
		int* p1, * p2 = NULL; // Initializing
		
		p1 = age;  // Compiler error, variables have different size
		p1 = &age; // "p1" points to the address of "age"
		p2 = p1; // Correct (both have the same size), p2 points to the address of p1
		*p2 = height; // Dereference "p2" and assign the value of "height"
		
	p Keep in mind that
	ul
		li by dereferencing the pointer you have direct access to the values
		li declaring a pointer looks very similar to dereferencing a pointer, but they are not the same
		li you should always declare a pointer with an initial value 
			code 0, NULL, null, nil

.slide
	h2 Pointer Examples
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		int firstvalue = 5, secondvalue = 15;
		int* p1, *p2;
		p1 = &firstvalue; // p1 = address of firstvalue
		p2 = &secondvalue; // p2 = address of secondvalue
		*p1 = 10; // value pointed by p1 = 10
		*p2 = *p1; // value pointed by p2 = value pointed by p1
		p1 = p2; // p1 = p2 (value of pointer is copied)
		*p1 = 20; // value pointed by p1 = 20 
		
		cout << "firstvalue is " << firstvalue << endl;
		cout << "secondvalue is " << secondvalue << endl;

.slide
	h2 Pointer Arithmetic
	
	p Addition and subtraction operations are allowed on pointers
	ul
		li If a pointer is incremented by one it points to the following element of its type in memory
		li The size in bytes of the pointer type is added to the pointer
		li Behavior of a pointer operation depends on the size of a pointer's data type

.slide
	h2 Pointer Examples
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		int a = 30;
		int* p1 = &a;

	p 
		code p1
		&nbsp; points to the address of 
		code a
		&nbsp;
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		p1++; // Increases the pointer by one unit (in this case 4 byte)
	
	p 
		code p1
		&nbsp; points to the last address + 4 bytes
		
	pre.prettyprint.
		p1--; // Decreases the pointer by one unit
	
	p 
		code p1
		&nbsp; now points to the address of 
		code a
		&nbsp; again
	
.slide
	h2 Pointer and Array
	
	p Identifier of an array is equivalent to the address of its first element
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		int array[5];
		int* p = array;
		int* p = &array[0]
		
		*p = 1; // == array[0]
		p++; // increase pointer address by 4 bytes
		*p = 2; // == array[1]
		*(p + 3) = 5 // == array[4]
	div.alert-message.error Array is a constant pointer!
	pre.prettyprint.
		array = p;
.slide
	h2 Pointer Arithmetic
	
	p The precedence of the operators depend on the position and brackets
	pre.prettyprint.
		int array[5];
		int* p = array;
		*p++ = 3; // first dereference and assign value, then increase pointer
		*(p+1) = 3; // add 4 bytes to pointer, dereference, assign value
		*++p = 4 // increase pointer value, dereference and assign
		int a  = *++p; // increase pointer value, dereference and assign
		int b  = *p++; // dereference, assign, increase pointer value
		
.slide
	h2 Pointer Arithmetic
	
	p Behaviour of a pointer operation depends on the size of a pointer's data type

	pre.prettyprint.
		short* sp = (short*)array; // short has 2 bytes
		*sp = 10; // 0000 0000 0000 1010
		
		// Increase by 2 bytes
		*(sp+1) = 20; // 0000 0000 0001 0100
	
	p Use a 
		code short
		&nbsp;pointer (2 byte) to access the memory, which then forms an integer of value 1.310.730
	
	table
		tr
			th.center byte 4
			th.center byte 3
			th.center byte 2
			th.center byte 1
		tr
			td.center 0000 0000
			td.center 0001 0100
			td.center 0000 0000
			td.center 0000 1010
		
.slide
	h2 Pointer to Pointer
	
	p Add an asterisk (*) for each level of reference in the declaration
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		char c = 'a';
		char* pC = &c;
		char** ppC = &pC;
		
		// Dereferencing
		*ppC; // reference to pC
		**ppC; // reference to c
	ul
		li
			code pC
			&nbsp;is a pointer 
		li 
			code ppC
			&nbsp;is a pointer to a pointer
	
	img(src="pointer_to_pointer.png")

.slide
	h2 The 
		code void
		&nbsp; Pointer
	
	ul
		li 
			code void
			&nbsp;pointers are a special type of pointers, in C++ they represent the absence of type 
		li They have an undetermined length and undetermined dereference properties
		li Therefore they have to be cast to a concrete pointer type 

	pre.prettyprint.
		int a = 100;
		void* pA = &p;
		
		*pA = 101; // Compiler error: 'void*' is not a pointer-to-object type
		*(int*)pA = 101; // Cast before dereference
	
	div.note The void pointer allows to point to any data type, from an integer value or a float to a string of characters. But in exchange they have a great limitation: the data pointed by them cannot be directly dereferenced (which is logical, since we have no type to dereference to), and for that reason we will always have to cast the address in the void pointer to some other pointer type that points to a concrete data type before dereferencing it.

	h2 Dynamic Memory
	
	ul
		li Until now we have only had as much memory available as we declared for our variables
		
		li Memory consumption is known at compile time
		li What if we need a variable amount of memory (determined during runtime)?
			div E.g. array with a user defined size
	
	p.alert-message.success Answer: Dynamic Memory
		
	p Allocate dynamic memory on the heap with the keyword 
		code new
		&nbsp;and multiple elements with 
		code new[]
		
.slide
	h2 Dynamic Memory
	
	p Memory allocation on the heap:
	p 
		code type * variable_name = new type;
	
	p 
		code type * variable_name = new type [ size ]; 
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		int* pInt = new int;
		int *pIntArray = new int[10];
		
		Rectangle* pRectangle = new Rectangle;
		Rectangle* pRectangles = new Rectangle[10];

.slide
	h2 Accessing Dynamic Memory
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		int* pInt= new int;
		char* pChar = new char;
		Rectangle* pRectangle = new Rectangle(10, 10);
		
		*pInt = 27;
		*pChar = 'z';
		
	div Access object members
	pre.prettyprint.
		pRectangle->getWidth(); // Use of arrow operator
		(*pRectangle).getWidth(); // Dot notation

.slide
	h2 Accessing Dynamic Memory
	
	p Index operator can be used on arrays
	pre.prettyprint.
		int* pInt= new int[100];
		Rectangle* pRect = new Rectangle[10];
		
		pInt[10] = 103;
		pRect[0] = Rectangle(10, 10); // constructor call
		pRect[2] = Rectangle(100, 100);
		
		Rectangle rect = pRect[0];
		int x = rect.getX();
		pRect = pRect + 2;
		rect = *pRect;

	h2 A program's memory

	p First an overview about the 4 different areas of a program's memory
	ol
		li Code area
			div where the compiled program sits in memory.
		li Globals area
			div where global variables are stored.
		li Heap
			div where dynamically allocated variables are allocated from.
		li Stack
			div where parameters and local variables are allocated from.
	
	p The memory is allocated based on how a variable is declared.


.slide
	h2 Memory Management - The stack
	
	p Stack is the place in memory where parameters and local variables are allocated, the stack is often referred as execution stack, control stack, run-time stack, or machine stack
	
	div.span9
		p In general, a stack is a container which holds items (like an array). You put items into the container (push) or take them down from it (pop). 
		p Compared to an array, the stack only let's you access the last item put into/onto it. A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) structure.
	div.span6
		img(src="stack.jpg")

.slide
	h2 Memory Memory - The stack
	
	p The memory on the stack is automatically cleaned up when the code block has returned.
	
	div Example
	pre.prettyprint.
		int increment(int a){
			int b = ++a;
			
			return b;
		} // after returning the value, the stack is cleaned up 
	
	p.alert-message.success You don't have to worry about memory allocation which is always nice!
	
.slide
	h2 Memory Management - The heap
	
	p The heap is a large pool of the memory, which is used for (dynamically allocated) objects created with the keyword 
		code new
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		int* pB = new int; // Memory is on the heap
		int a = 10; // Memory of "a" is allocated on the stack
		int pA = &a; // Memory of "pB" is allocated on the stack
	
	p Dynamically allocated memory "survive" code blocks, but not the variables
	p.alert-message.error Dynamically allocated memory has to be freed by the programmer (no garbage collector)
	
.slide
	h2 Memory Management - The heap
	
	p Programmer has to decide when to free memory when it is no longer needed
	ul
		li Memory becomes available for other allocation requests
		li Memory can be freed with the 
			code delete
			&nbsp;or
			code delete[]
			&nbsp;operator
		li Argument is a pointer to a memory block previously allocated with 
			code new
	pre.prettyprint.
		int* pB = new int;
		int* pArray = new int[10];
		...
		delete pB;
		delete[] pArray;

.slide
	h2 Memory Management - Leaks
	
	p Memory leaks occur when there is memory allocated, to which you don't have access to.
	
	p.alert-message.info Good memory management is important!
	
	h3 When do you clean up memory?
	
	ul
		li When the variable is no longer needed
		li As long as you have access to it

	p.alert-message.info The destructor is a good place to free memory!
	

.slide
	h2 Memory Management - Leaks
	
	div Example of a memory leak
	pre.prettyprint.
		void print(int value){
			int* b = new int;
			cout << value;
		}
		
		print(10);
	
	p Variable 
		code b
		&nbsp;is deleted after the return of the function, but the memory is still allocated, you don't have access to the variable outside of the function

.slide
	h2 Memory Management - Leaks
	
	div How to do it better
	pre.prettyprint.
		void print(int value){
			int* b = new int;
			cout << value;
			delete b;
		}
		
		print(10);
	
	p Delete the memory as long as you have access to!
	
.slide
	h2 Memory Management - Leaks
	
	div Another example
	pre.prettyprint.
		int* newIntegerWithValue(int value){
			int* b = new int;
			*b = value;
			
			return b;
		}
		
		int* integer = newIntegerWithValue(10);
		...
		delete integer;
	
	p After returning the function, you still have access to the dynamically allocated memory
	
	p.alert-message.info Use the stack when your variable will not be used after the current function returns. Use the heap when the data in the variable is needed beyond the lifetime of the current code block.
	
.slide
	h2 Back to dynamic memory
	
	pre.prettyprint.
		class Rectangle{
		int _x, _y, _width, _height;
		char* _pixels;
		
		public:
			Rectangle(int x = 0, int y = 0, int width = 0, int height = 0){
				_x = x;
				_y = x;
				_width = width;
				_height = height;
				
				// Dynamic memory allocation
				_pixels = new char[_width*_height];
			}
		
			~Rectangle(){
				delete[] _pixels;
			}
		};
	
	p Free dynamically allocated memory for the variable 
		code _pixels
		&nbsp;in the destructor.

	h2 Memory Management - Destructor

	pre.prettyprint.
		{
			Rectangle rect(10, 10, 400, 300);
		} // Automatically cleans up stack memory and calls destructor
		
		Rectangle* pRect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 400, 300);
		delete pRect; // Cleans up heap memory and calls desctructor

	p Destructor is automatically called
	ul
		li on local variable when declaration scope is left
		li on dynamically allocated objects when delete is called
		li on statically allocated objects when program is terminated
		li on every array element, if an array is destroyed

	h2 The 
		code this
		&nbsp;Pointer
	
	p In a non-static context, 
		code this
		&nbsp;is a pointer to the 'current' object
		
	p Any plain (unqualified) reference to a non-static member is implicitly extended to a qualified reference by adding 
		code this
	ul
		li var -> this->var
		li func(...) -> this->func(...)
		
	p.alert-message.info The this pointer is not available in static member functions!

	h2 Objects vs. Pointers to Objects
	
	p Object values may become unhandy
	ul
		li It is costly to copy full objects
		li Objects should be mainly passed to functions by reference
			ul
				li Use of reference parameters in method declarations is recommended
				li Otherwise the copy constructor is invoked on each function call with an object as argument to create a temporary copy of the object
				

.slide
	h2 Objects vs. Pointers to Objects
	
	p Object pointers are frequently preferred
	ul
		li It is cheap to copy pointers to objects
		li Objects referenced by pointers should be created on the heap by new
		li Such objects must be explicitly destroyed by delete, otherwise 'memory leaks' will arise in the program. Destructors of objects must explicitly free the space of all objects referenced by pointers

	h2 Namespaces
	
	p Namespaces allow to group entities like classes, objects and functions under a name.
